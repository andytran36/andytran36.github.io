	<p>
		I'm currently studying <strong>Software Engineering</strong> at the
		<a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca"><strong>University of Calgary</strong></a>
		in Alberta, Canada.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some of my passions include <strong>weightlifting, video games, and music.</strong> <br>
		I have been actively weightlifting for the last 5 years, it's something that keeps me active and lets me reset
		whenever I'm stressed or need a break.
		Video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, it has taught me a lot about
		communication and teamwork.
		Currently, I mostly listen to EDM, R&B, and pop; you can browse my Spotify profile

	<p>
		I'm currently searching for an internship ranging from 4-16 months starting in Fall 2020.

		<p class="description">
			This is a website for students to post confessions to their respective university forums. Users can post
			images or text and get responses from their peers.
			Course project done in a group of 7 for Software Architectures class.
			Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with other frameworks such as Vue and Hapi, using Node.js for runtime.
			The application has microservices for comments, posts, and notifications which connect to the main
			application.
			The frontend connects to the main application via RESTful API and the main application redirects the
			requests to the correct services.

			<h4>How this project came to be</h3>
				Our group was prompted to create a web application that users could login, post, and comment on posts.
				The implementation of the project had to use several software architectures such as CQRS, Event
				Sourcing, MVC, and Microservices.
				Our idea was to create a page where students could post their thoughts and confessions in one place.
				We used Trello and Discord to communicate; Trello was used to keep track of tasks that needed to be
				done, tasks in progress, and finished tasks.
				Discord was used to have meeting since we could not meet up in person due to COVID-19.
		</p>
		<p class="teachings">
			<h4>What I learned from this project</h3>
				Prior to this project, I have not done much programming in JavaScript aside from some Udemy courses on
				web development.
				This project helped me udnerstand how important communicaion is in projects with larger teams.
				My group mates were extremely positive and open to communicate which facilitated efficient work.
				In term of technical skills, my JavaScript skills have advanced quickly to keep up with my teammates,
				and I have a greater understanding of acync, await, and promises.

			<a href="https://github.com/andytran36/project-c" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>
		</h3>
		<p class="description">
			Turn-based JRPG-styled game similar to old installments of the Final Fantasy Series.
			This project was done over reading week of Fall 2019.
			Players can explore the overworld and randomly run into encounters which prompts a battle.

			<h4>How this project came to be</h3>
				This project came about from a personal passion of mine.
				Since before I pursued my education in software engineering, I always liked to imagine how games come to
				life from ideas.
				I always imagined how things like health and money are calculated and how exp is distributed over the
				course of the game to create balanced game progression.
				This project was my way of exploring this passion of mine a little more and dig a little deeper.
		</p>
		<p class="teachings">
			<h4>What I learned from this project</h3>
				I learned a lot from this project and greatly developed confidence in my understanding of OOP and my
				programming abilities in Java.
				I ran into several challenges over the course of the project such as implementation of enemy encounters
				and combat.
				To overcome this problem, I did research into how other game developers managed their game states and
				chose an implementation idea that best suited my application.
				In solving these challenges as they appeared I more about how to prevent issues ahead of time by
				conducting more research.
				This project deepened by appreciation for games and game developers by showing me how much work is
				actually needed to make a well-made game.
